Convolutional Neural Network in autonomous driving. Feedforward network that learns features by itself through kernal optimization. Applied to make predictions across many different types of data including text, images, and audio. AI supports this through deep learning algorithms Machine learning Neocognitron was used before AI. The neocognitron is a hierarchical, multilayered artificial neural network the precursor to CNN. Deep Learning is being used for this technology. It is a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks to perform tasks. This technology is used in medical image analysis, natural language processing, and image and video recognition to name a few applications. CNNs fail to encode relative spatial information.
